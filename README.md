><h2 align="center">Important Update</h2>
><p align="center">The Aniwatch/Zoro Megacloud server fetching API has undergone some changes <sup><a href="https://github.com/ghoshRitesh12/aniwatch/issues/4#issuecomment-2532740768">[1]</a></sup>, causing the scraper package to fail in fetching streaming sources <sup><a href=https://github.com/ghoshRitesh12/aniwatch/issues/4>[2]</a></sup>. I am unsure if this issue will be resolved. In the meantime, I am working on implementing significant changes to use alternative servers for data and streaming.</p>
